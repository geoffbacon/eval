## evaluate

This repository holds code to assess learnt semantic representations.

### TODO
- Add all intrinsic datasets
- Travis CI
- Docs using Sphinx
- Add notebooks with examples in scripts/


### STRUCTURE OF THE REPOSITORY
- The scripts directory holds notebooks exploring datasets and replicating studies.
- The data directory contains datasets for both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods. Each dataset has its own subdirectory so that it can 
possible include readmes, licenses, multiple files and preprocessing steps.
